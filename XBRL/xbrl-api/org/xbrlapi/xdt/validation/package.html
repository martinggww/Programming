<body bgcolor="white">

	Supports the analysis of XDT dimensions for XBRL concepts.
	
	<p>
	This package provides support for analysis of the XDT dimension constructs
	associated with a given XBRL concept.  It does so by giving non-static access
	to static implementation of such functionality.
  </p>
	
	<h2>Package Specification</h2>

  <p>
    This package provides for comprehensive analysis of XBRL dimensions constructs 
    for XBRL concepts.  It enables users to take a given concept and determine:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>The hypercubes related to a given concept by has-hypercube relationships.</li>
    <li>The concepts that this concept inherits hypercube relationships from, 
    where the dreadful targetRole attribute is used to tie together domain-member 
    inheritance paths.</li>
    <li>The hypercubes that this concept inherits, where the dreadful targetRole
    attribute is used to tie together domain-member inheritance paths.</li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
