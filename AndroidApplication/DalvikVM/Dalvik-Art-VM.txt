Dalvik virtual machine.
a. Each process has its own virtual machine. Android run mulitple virtual machines.
b. DVM is built specificially for Android, addressing for battery life, processing power.
c. Java tool is free but JVM is not free. So Google developers make their own VM.
   It's like java source code ->Java Compiler->Java byte code->JVM.
                                                             ->Dalvik byte codes->DVM
d. Virtual machine is a software implementation of a machine that executes programs like
   a hardware machine
e. A set of registers, a stack(optional), an executable environment, a garbage-collected heap
   a constant pool, A method storage area, an instruction set.
f. OS virtual machine, process virtual machine, support execution of a single process.
