Dalvik virtual machine.
a. Each process has its own virtual machine. Android run mulitple virtual machines.
b. DVM is built specificially for Android, addressing for battery life, processing power.
c. Java tool is free but JVM is not free. So Google developers make their own VM.
   It's like java source code ->Java Compiler->Java byte code->JVM.
                                                             ->Dalvik byte codes->DVM
d. Virtual machine is a software implementation of a machine that executes programs like
   a hardware machine
e. A set of registers, a stack(optional), an executable environment, a garbage-collected heap
   a constant pool, A method storage area, an instruction set.
f. OS virtual machine, process virtual machine, support execution of a single process.
g. stack machine, load/store; register machine, instructions to be encoded in source and 
   destination registers.

h. Shared constant pool
   Java bytecode to dalvik .dex code
   constant pool
   .jar file                .dex file
   constant pool,           string_id[]  constant pool
   data                     type_id[]
                            proto_id[]
   constant pool            fields_id[]
   data                     methods_id[]
shared constant pool
less bytes, dispatches, reads and writes, which is GREAT!
Stack virtual machine vs register virtual machine!

i. Set byte ordering and structure alignment
   Aligns the number variables to 32/64bits
   Boundary 
   Significant optimizations because of elimination of symbolic field/method lookup at runtime
   Aid of Just-in-time compiler.
