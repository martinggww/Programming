Tutorial two: OOP basics
1. static function or variables are shared by all instances.
2. private function can't be called by referenced object.
3. Non-static function or variables can't be used in static function.
4. abstract class can't be instanced.Period.
5. All abstract methods must be overriden, but not all methods need to be overriden.

6. Interface is class only has abstract methods
7. You can add as many interfaces to a class using implementations as you want
8. Use only public static and final fields.
9. By default all methods are abstract, so no abstract key words are written.
10.
