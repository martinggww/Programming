Adapter pattern connects two independent interfaces
A real example is a card reader reads memory card, then transfort data to laptop.
Or connect to different open-changing APIs. Like if you are using the third-party apis 
like paypay.sendMoney(), if paypal change the api to paypal.sendAmount(), then you'll
have to change the codes everywhere.

Adapter pattern is allowing the interface of an existing class to be used from other
interfaces. It is used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their
source codes.
