 * You may have been using Java for a while. 
 * Do you think a simple Java array question can be a challenge? 
 * Let's use the following problem to test.

Problem: Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps. 
For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is 
rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

How many different ways do you know to solve this problem?
